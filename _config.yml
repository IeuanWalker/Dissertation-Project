title: Semantic Web and Natural Language Processing - Dissertation Project
description: The semantic web is the next evaluation of the world wide web. There are many names for the semantic web such as linked data, the web of data and even web 3.0.
 What is the semantic web? Well to summarise my dissertation, the semantic web is still in development but it is a set of new languages and technologies that are used to connect data across the web. But it doesnâ€™t only connect different resources across the web it also adds meaning and understanding to the data. With the combination of connected data and the meaning/ understanding of the data, it is enabling machines to process a lot of information on the web so that they can perform complex tasks for us.
 Companies such as Apple, Google, and IBM are using the semantic web to enhance their AI systems. In my project, I will be utilising a small part of AI known as Natural Language Processing (NLP).
 For my dissertation, I will build a semantic web search engine combined with natural language processing to build a smart search engine. You can find the entire project in the submitted documents or at the following link - https://github.com/IeuanWalker/Dissertation-Project. I have also created a video demonstration of the web application which is also available in the submitted documents or at the following link - https://youtu.be/luJhd5diDgg.
